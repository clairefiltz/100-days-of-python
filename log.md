### Day 3: June 27, 2022 - Monday


**Today's Progress**: I did not have a lot of time today, so I completed one codewars challenge, which reviewed some fundamental functions. 

**Thoughts:** I should review more of the fundamentals of Python. This will help me later on when working on my projects.
