# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 24, 2022 - Friday


**Today's Progress**: I thought of projects I want to work on and checked codewars challenges that I could do.

### Day 1: June 25, 2022 - Saturday


**Today's Progress**: I completed one codewars challenge!

**Thoughts:** It had been a while since I wrote some code, so just this one exercise was a challenge.

### Day 2: June 26, 2022 - Sunday


**Today's Progress**: I completed two codewars challenges and learned a bit more about RegEx.  

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to learn more about RegEx, as this is one topic I want to get better at.

### Day 3: June 27, 2022 - Monday


**Today's Progress**: I did not have a lot of time today, so I completed one codewars challenge, which reviewed some fundamental functions. 

**Thoughts:** I should review more of the fundamentals of Python. This will help me later on when working on my projects.
